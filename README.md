# SketchSphere: Toon Shader with Three.js and WebGL

**SketchSphere** is a graphic project that brings the artistic style of toon shading to 3D models using Three.js and WebGL. The project focuses on rendering techniques that mimic the classic hand-drawn aesthetics of cartoons.

## Features

- **3D Model Integration**: Seamlessly import and center 3D models within the Three.js scene.
- **Toon Shading**: Implement toon shaders, specifically crafted in WebGL's fragment and vertex shaders, to achieve the cartoon-like rendering.
- **Interactive Controls**: Use ArcBallControls for intuitive interaction with the scene.
- **Outline Effect**: Accentuate the toon effect with an outline effect that emphasizes model edges.

By leveraging the power of WebGL and custom shader programming, **SketchSphere** showcases a creative approach to 3D graphics, offering a unique, stylized look and feel to the rendered scenes.
